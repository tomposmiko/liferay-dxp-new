Remove dates and other superfluous information from batch-engine.json and
foo-object-definition.json.

Use meaning external reference codes instead of generated UUID for
foo-object-definition.json.

Fix create_remote_app.sh
	name: ${CUSTOM_ELEMENT_NAME}
	This should be something like "Fox Remote App" instead of "fox-remote-app"
