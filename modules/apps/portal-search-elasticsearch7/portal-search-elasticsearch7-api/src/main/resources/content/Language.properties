client-transport-ping-timeout=Client Transport Ping Timeout
client-transport-ping-timeout-help=Enter the time (in seconds) the client node waits for a ping response from a node. If unset, the default Elasticsearch client.transport.ping_timeout is used.
client-transport-sniff=Client Transport Sniff
client-transport-sniff-help=If this is checked, cluster sniffing is enabled to dynamically discover available nodes in the cluster.

http-cors-enabled=Http CORS Enabled
http-cors-enabled-help=If this is checked, cross-origin resource sharing is enabled, which determines whether a browser on another origin can make requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web front-end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect.
http-enabled=Http Enabled
http-enabled-help=This setting was deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If this is checked, the HTTP layer is enabled. If unchecked, the HTTP layer is disabled on nodes which are not meant to serve REST requests directly.
index-name-prefix=Index Name Prefix
index-name-prefix-help=Set the prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.

log-exceptions-only-help=If this is checked, logs exceptions only from Elasticsearch and does not re-throw them.
network-bind-host=Network Bind Host
network-bind-host-help=Specify the network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to listen for incoming requests.
network-host=Network Host
network-host-help=Set the hostname or IP address bound to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time.
network-publish-host=Network Publish Host
network-publish-host-help=Set the single interface the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it.
number-of-index-replicas=Number of Index Replicas
number-of-index-replicas-help=Enter the number of replicas for each Liferay index. If unset, no replicas are used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
number-of-index-shards=Number of Index Shards
number-of-index-shards-help=Set the number of shards to use when a Liferay index is created. If unset, a single shard will be used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
operation-mode=Operation Mode
operation-mode-help=The REMOTE operation mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. The EMBEDDED operation mode starts Portal with an internal Elasticsearch instance in the same JVM. The EMBEDDED operation mode is unsupported.
override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings
override-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings to fully replace the default mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings.
