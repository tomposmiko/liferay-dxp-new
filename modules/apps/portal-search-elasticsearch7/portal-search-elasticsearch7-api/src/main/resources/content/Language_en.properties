http-cors-enabled=HTTP CORS Enabled
http-cors-enabled-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED (Development) mode. If this is checked, cross-origin resource sharing is enabled, which determines whether a browser on another origin can make requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web front-end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect.
http-ssl-enabled=HTTP SSL Enabled
http-ssl-enabled-help=Enable or disable TLS/SSL.
index-name-prefix=Index Name Prefix
index-name-prefix-help=Set the prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.

network-host=Network Host
network-host-addresses=Network Host Addresses
network-host-addresses-help=Set the remote HTTP hosts to connect to.
network-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED (Development) mode. Set the hostname or IP address bound to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time.
network-publish-host=Network Publish Host
network-publish-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED (Development) mode. Set the single interface the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it.
node-name=Node Name
node-name-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED (Development) mode. Set the name of the node to start. If unset, "liferay" is used.
number-of-index-replicas=Number of Company and System Index Replicas
number-of-index-replicas-help=Set the number of replicas for each Liferay company and system index. If unset, no replicas are used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
number-of-index-shards=Number of Company and System Index Shards
number-of-index-shards-help=Set the number of shards to use when a Liferay company and system index is created. If unset, a single shard will be used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
operation-mode=Operation Mode
operation-mode-help=This configuration is deprecated. If Production Mode is enabled, this setting will be ignored. The REMOTE (Production) operation mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster, which can also be achieved by enabling Production mode. The EMBEDDED (Development) operation mode starts a child process running an external sidecar Elasticsearch instance. EMBEDDED operation mode is unsupported.
override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings
override-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings to fully replace the default mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings.
password-help=Set the password for authenticating to Elasticsearch if Authentication Enabled is checked.
production-mode-enabled=Production Mode Enabled
production-mode-enabled-help=Enable Production mode. If this is checked, Production mode will be enabled and the Operation Mode configuration will be ignored. Production mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. If this is unchecked, the Operation Mode configuration will be used.
