frontend-js-jquery-description=Enabling JQuery will make the library available in the global object as window.$ as well as AUI.$ inside the AlloyUI namespace. Enable this setting if you rely on the library being present globally or attached to the AUI object. For changes made here to take effect, you must reload the browser page after saving.
