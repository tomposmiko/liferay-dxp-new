liferay-releng-app-description=This app integrates Liferay DXP with Apache Solr 8, the popular open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project. Solr includes powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing distributed search and index replication, and it powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites. The installation of this app requires specific configurations listed in the Official Documentation. On installing, enabling, and configuring this app, Liferay DXP communicates with a remotely deployed Solr 8 server for indexing and searching.<br />For detailed compatibility information, including the compatible Solr 8 minor versions and required Liferay DXP patch levels, see the Search Engine Compatibility Matrix: https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651.
