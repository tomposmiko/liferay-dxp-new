openoffice-server-enabled-help=Enabling OpenOffice integration allows Documents & Media and Wiki to provide conversion functionality. This is tested with OpenOffice 2.3.x through 3.2.x. It is recommended that you have OpenOffice on the same machine. Using a remote host for the instance is not fully supported and could lead to various problems. To start OpenOffice as service, run the command: soffice -headless -accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" (Automatic Copy)
