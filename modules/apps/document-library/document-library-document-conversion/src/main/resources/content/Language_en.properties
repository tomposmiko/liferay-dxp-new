openoffice-server-enabled-help=Enabling OpenOffice integration allows the Document Library portlet and the Wiki portlet to provide conversion functionality. This is tested with OpenOffice 2.3.x through 3.2.x. It is recommended that you have OpenOffice on the same machine. Using a remote host for the instance is not fully supported and could lead to various problems. To start OpenOffice as service, run the command: soffice -headless -accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;"
