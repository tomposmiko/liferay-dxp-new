liferay-releng-app-description=The Liferay Cross-Cluster Replication for Elasticsearch app lets you perform read operations from a local cluster that has been configured to replicate, or follow, the indicies of a remote cluster. The local cluster containing the replicated indicies must be configured manually before this app can execute requests against it. You can find more information about Cross-Cluster Replication at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/xpack-ccr.html (Automatic Copy)
