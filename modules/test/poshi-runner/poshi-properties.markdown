Note, all the mobile browsers have not been tested in a long time, and require other setups. Also note, some browsers are OS specific.

### test.batch.max.subgroup.size

### test.batch.property.names
Sets the names of properties used to filter out tests in PQL. Must be paired with test.batch.property.values.

### test.batch.property.values
Sets the values of properties used to filter out tests in PQL. Must be paired with test.batch.property.names.

### test.batch.run.type
Sets how groups of tests are organized. Valid values are _sequential_ or _single_. Sequential will group the tests based off of the other test.batch.* properties, allowing for multiple tests to be set in one axis. Single sets one test per axis. The grouping of tests is printed to another properties file which is read by the CI infrastructure.

### test.case.available.property.names
Sets a comma-delimited list of properties can be set for tests within Poshi.

### test.case.required.property.names
Sets a comma-delimited list of properties that must be set for tests within Poshi.

### test.console.log.file.name

### test.console.shut.down.file.name
Sets the path to the log file containing the shutdown process of an application server.

### test.csv.report.property.names

### test.include.dir.names
Sets a comma-delimited list of directory paths to include in the Poshi project files.

### test.name
Sets the test case(s) to run. This can be the specific test case command name, or the name of the test case file. Additionally, it can be a comma-delimited list of a combination of both, which will run sequentially. In order to actually take advantage of this, the tests themselves must be configured with proper teardowns to run sequentially.

### test.poshi.warnings.file.name

### test.retry.command.wait.time
