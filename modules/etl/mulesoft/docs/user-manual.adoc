= Liferay Connector

== Overview
The Anypoint Liferay Connector connects Liferay to other platforms and services
in the Mulesoft ecosystem.

Here, you'll learn how the Liferay connector is designed and to set up and
configure a basic flow using a Liferay connector.

== Prerequisites
You should be familiar already with Mule and Anypoint Studio. To learn about
Studio, consider completing an Anypoint Studio Tutorial. You should know about
Mule Concepts, Elements in a Mule Flow, and Global Elements.

For connector prerequisites, check link:release-notes.adoc[release notes].

== Liferay Connector Design
Liferay Connector is dynamically configured using OpenAPI 3.0 documents that
describe all Liferay APIs at https://app.swaggerhub.com/organizations/liferayinc[Swagger Hub]

Each OpenAPI document is also deployed dynamically in your Liferay Portal
instance under following schema:
....
http://[host]:[port]/o/[headless-api-app-name]/[version]/openapi.json
....

This OpenAPI document is dynamically generated based on your deployed RESTful
web services, so it is the most current and accurate description of your APIs.
More about Liferay APIs can be found
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/get-started-discover-the-api[here].

Once you specify an OpenAPI document endpoint, Liferay connector is dynamically
configured with paths, path/query parameters and entity metadata defined in the
OpenAPI document.

Liferay connector works with any OpenAPI 3.0 document that follows Liferay
standards. A single Liferay connector supports all Liferay APIs.

== Connector Configuration
To configure the Liferay connector, you must

. Select authentication method and enter required authentication parameters
. Specify OpenAPI document endpoint

Choose between *Basic* and *OAuth2* authentication methods.
Read more about authentication methods
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/making-authenticated-requests[here].

Basic Authentication::
Enter a *User name* and *Password*.

OAuth2::
* Enter a *Client Key* and *Client Secret*.

You must set up OAuth2 authorization in your Liferay instance first by following
the instructions
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/oauth-2-0#creating-an-application[here].
Liferay supports the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant type. Select *Headless
Server* for the Client Profile.

Liferay generates a Client ID (*Consumer Key*) and Client Secret (*Consumer
Secret*) to use in your Liferay connector configuration. Before you can start
using endpoints with OAuth2 authorization you must also enable
https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/oauth2-scopes[scopes].
Select the desired scope and check authorization options you need, such as
_everything_, _everything.write_ or _everything.read_.

Specify OpenAPI Document::
Once authorized, you can specify the Liferay API you want to use. Specify the
OpenAPI document endpoint that describes the API you want. For example, the
Commerce Admin Catalog API is here:

http://[host]:[port]/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/openapi.json

Enter it into the
*OpenAPI Spec URL* field. [%hardbreaks]

* Configuration example using Basic authentication

```xml
 <liferay:config name="Liferay_Config_Catalog">
 <liferay:basic-connection _username=${username} _password=${password} _openApiSpecPath="http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/openapi.json"/>
 </liferay:config>
```

* Configuration example using OAuth 2.0
```xml
 <liferay:config name="Liferay_Config_Catalog">
    <liferay:oauth2-connection _consumerKey="${consumerKey}" _consumerSecret=${consumerSecret} _openApiSpecPath="http://localhost:8080/o/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0/openapi.json"/>
 </liferay:config>
```

If *Test Connection* is successful you can start building flows using the
Liferay connector!

== Operations
Now that you've created your Mule project and imported and configured the
Liferay connector, you can build your Mule flows using Liferay connector
operations. Operations *Create*, *Delete*, *Get* and *Update* resources defined
by your OpenAPI document. Each operation implements and exposes different parts
of the specified OpenAPI document.

=== Create Operation

Create exposes all endpoints that are manipulated by HTTP POST.

The SwaggerHub UI shows all available path parameters, request body
structures, and all possible responses.

Once you select desired endpoint from the Endpoint selector the connector
dynamically generates related Metadata.

Next, you define input parameters. Input parameters support all Liferay RESTful
web services and need not be used with every endpoint:

[%header,cols=4*]
|===
|Parameter name
|Type
|Description
|Required

|Endpoint
|String
|Drop down list of available endpoints that support create operation
|Yes

|Records
|Object
|Object to be created
|Yes

|Path Params
|Object
|Map with path parameter values
|Yes (if required by endpoint)

|Query Params
|Object
|Map with query parameter values
|No
|===

=== Delete Operation
The Delete operation exposes all endpoints that are manipulated by HTTP DELETE.
Input parameters:

[%header,cols=4*]
|===
|Parameter name
|Type
|Description
|Required

|Endpoint
|String
|Drop down list of available endpoints that support delete operation
|Yes

|Path Params
|Object

|Yes (if required by endpoint)

|Query Params
|Object
|Map with query parameter values
|No
|===

=== Get Operation
The Get operation exposes all endpoints that are manipulated by HTTP GET.
Input parameters:

[%header,cols=4*]
|===
|Parameter name
|Type
|Description
|Required

|Endpoint
|String
|Drop down list of available endpoints that support get operation
|Yes

|Path Params
|Object
|Map with path parameter values
|Yes (if required by endpoint)

|Query Params
|Object
|Map with query parameter values
|No
|===

=== Update Operation
The Update operation exposes all endpoints that are manipulated by HTTP PATCH.
Input parameters:

[%header,cols=4*]
|===
|Parameter name
|Type
|Description
|Required

|Endpoint
|String
|Drop down list of available endpoints that support update operation
|Yes

|Records
|Object
|Object to be updated
|Yes

|Path Params
|Object
|Map with path parameter values

|No
|===

You should use
https://app.swaggerhub.com/organizations/liferayinc as documentation for Liferay
connector operations.
You can also use the OpenAPI document from the endpoint you defined in
connector configuration, in which case you lose the helpful UI offered by
SwaggerHub editor.
