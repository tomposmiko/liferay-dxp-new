# Building Liferay Portal

System Requirements:
* Quad Core i7 Processor
* 8 GB Memory
* JDK 8
* Apache Ant
* Gradle

The first step to contributing to Liferay Portal is to clone the liferay-portal repo from Github and build the platform using Apache Ant.

## Build Liferay Portal:

To build Liferay Portal from source do the following:

* Fork liferay-portal repo on Github - [https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal)

* Clone the forked repo’s master branch (or preferred branch) with no commit history:

      git clone https://github.com/<github username>/liferay-portal --branch master --single-branch --depth 1

* Add main liferay-portal repo as an upstream for fetching changes:

      git remote add upstream https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal

* Build master branch from source for testing customizations:

      cd liferay-portal
      ant all

* Test the newly built bundle:

      cd ../bundles
      ./tomcat-8.0.32/bin/startup.sh

## Building a Module in liferay-portal

A module can be built from within liferay-portal without recompiling the whole platform.  To build a module, do the following:

* The platform must be completely compiled once using the method above.  This is due to the fact that the initial build initializes the build environment.

* To build a module located in: **liferay-portal/modules/apps/collaboration/comment/comment-web** run:

      cd liferay-portal/modules
      ../gradlew :apps:collaboration:comment:comment-web:deploy

* If all goes well the following should appear in the bundle logs:

      20:31:55,899 INFO  [fileinstall-/Users/jamie/liferay/repos/contrib/bundles/osgi/modules][BundleStartStopLogger:38] STOPPED com.liferay.comment.web_1.1.8 [243]

      20:31:56,038 INFO  [Refresh Thread: Equinox Container: 208f839d-2b6b-0017-1f31-cc9c6b1fc91b][BundleStartStopLogger:35] STARTED com.liferay.comment.web_1.1.8 [243]

# Making Changes

When making changes, it’s best to start off by creating a ticket in JIRA and referencing the ticket number from within any commits and pull requests.

## JIRA

Create a ticket in JIRA by doing the following:

* Sign up for a [JIRA Account](https://issues.liferay.com) to track progress on the feature, improvement, or bug fix you want to implement. We'll refer to these as *issues* from now on.

* [Submit a ticket](https://issues.liferay.com) for your issue. If a ticket already exists for the issue, participate via the existing ticket.

* Describe the issue clearly. If it is a bug, include steps to reproduce it.

* Select an appropriate category for the issue.

* Select the earliest version of the product affected by the issue.

* Respond to the Contributor License Agreement displayed by clicking the Contribute Solution button.

## Github

Submit your custom changes to Github using the following process:

* Create a topic branch to hold your changes based on upstream/master:

      git fetch upstream
      git checkout -b my-custom-change upstream/master

* Commit logical units of work including a reference to your ticket in JIRA.  For example:

      LPS-83432 Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete

* Test your changes thoroughly! Consider the wide variety of operating systems, databases, application servers, and other related technologies Liferay Portal supports. Make sure your changes in one environment don't break something in another environment.

* Before pushing your branch to your fork on Github it’s often a good idea to rebase on the updated version of upstream/master:

      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/master

* Push changes in your branch to your fork:

      git push origin my-custom-change

* Submit the pull request to the liferay-portal repo.

* In the LPS ticket, provide a link to your GitHub pull request and* You're done! Well, not quite ... be sure to respond to comments and questions to your pull request until it is closed.

# Tooling

Creating customizations and debugging code can be made easier using tooling.

Install the following tools to aid in development:

* Blade Tools - [https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-blade-cli](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-blade-cli)

* Liferay IDE - [https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-ide](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-ide).   Use the [generate-modules-classpath](https://web.liferay.com/web/jorge.diaz/blog/-/blogs/debugging-liferay-7-0-generate-modules-classpath-in-eclipse-using-generate_modules_classpath-sh) script to import Portal Core and all of the modules located in liferay-portal.

* IntelliJ -  Use [liferay-intellij](https://github.com/holatuwol/liferay-intellij) to help configure the environment.
