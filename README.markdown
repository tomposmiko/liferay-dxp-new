## Quick Start

To get up and running quickly, follow the steps below:

1. Download a [pre-built Liferay Portal release](http://liferay.com/downloads).
   For starters, it's recommended to choose Liferay Portal bundled with Tomcat.

2. Download and install
   [Java (JDK) 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
   (if necessary) in your local environment.

3. Extract the downloaded pre-built Liferay Portal bundle into a folder.

4. Navigate to the bundle's `liferay-ce-portal-[version]/tomcat-[version]/bin`
   folder and execute `startup.bat` (Windows) or `startup.sh` (Unix/Linux/Mac OS
   X), depending on your operating system.

5. A server console opens, which starts your Liferay Portal instance. Once your
   instance is ready to use, the portal URL address (http://localhost:8080) is
   automatically opened in your default browser.

6. You're presented a Basic Configuration page. Complete the configuration
   options.

    Liferay Portal uses an embedded database (HSQL) to make installation fast
    and easy. This database is not ready for production, so consider configuring
    a production-ready database (e.g., MySQL) if you plan on doing more than
    just exploring/testing.

7. Agree to the terms and conditions, create a password, and configure a
   security question/answer.

You can now use Liferay Portal!

For more detailed installation instructions, refer to the
[system administrator guide](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment) on the
Liferay Developer Network.
